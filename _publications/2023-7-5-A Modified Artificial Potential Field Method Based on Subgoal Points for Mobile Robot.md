Abstract:
In this paper, a modified artificial potential field (MAPF) method was proposed for general mobile robot navigation system. This MAPF method can effectively solve the unreachable goal problem and the local minima problem of traditional APF method. The first key idea of MAPF method is to modify the repulsive force function and thus optimize the direction of total repulsive force; the second key idea is to generate a serials of subgoal points around obstacles with specific method, so as to help the robot escape from or keep away from local minima area. By comparing with other similar algorithms in simulation environment, the MAPF algorithm can generate shorter paths efficiently. More importantly, it also can generate effective paths in multi-obstacle environment where other algorithms cannot. Finally the simulation results verified the reasonability and practicability of the proposed MAPF method.
