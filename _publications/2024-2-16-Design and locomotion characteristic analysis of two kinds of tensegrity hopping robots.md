Abstract:
This study proposed two kinds of tensegrity hopping robots, which were actuated by push-pull electromagnets and servo motors, respectively. Both tensegrity robots are able to conduct stable and consecutive hopping actions. This paper covers the robots' structural designs, theoretical modeling of the hopping actuators, and detailed analysis of the robot's self-righting properties, all of which are validated by corresponding experimental and simulational results. The first hopping robot could hop forward at an average speed of 0.641 body length/s. Although the second robot has a lower moving speed of 0.237 body length/s, its average jumping height of 0.301 m is nearly 2.5 times higher than that of the first robot. Then compared with other tensegrity rolling robots, the proposed two robots show obvious advantages in locomotion performance over their counterparts. Therefore, the proposed robots can have large potential in many fields such as space exploration, urban search, military surveillance, etc.
