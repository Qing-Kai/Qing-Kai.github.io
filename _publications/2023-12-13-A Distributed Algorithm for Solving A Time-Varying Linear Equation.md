Abstract:
This paper studies the problem of cooperatively solving a time-varying linear equation of the form A(t)x(t)=b(t) , which always has a unique solution. Each agent has access to only some rows of the time-varying augmented matrix [A(t) b(t)] . We propose a distributed algorithm for solving the time-varying linear equation. The proposed distributed algorithm enforces local solutions to track local time-varying manifolds corresponding to local linear sub-equations while simultaneously reaching a consensus. This enables all local solutions to converge to the solution of the original time-varying linear equation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through its application in a cooperative monitoring task.
